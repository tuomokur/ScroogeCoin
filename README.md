Works best in web-browsers on large screen ( Firefox or Chrome) . Not made for mobile.

Pick start and end date and click search. Results appear on right side.
Best way to make a new search is to refresh the site before new search.

- Global variables
- Function calls with setTimeOut. Should use async methods
- No memory handling on results
- Last feature not implemented
